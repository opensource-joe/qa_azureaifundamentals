# Understanding the Azure OpenAI Service

## An Introduction to Generative AI
- OpenAI has created groundbreaking technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E.
- technologies are built with AI models that can take natural language input from a user and return a machine-created response human-like response.
- Azure OpenAI Service is a partnership between MS and OpenAI that allows users to build enterprise-grade solutions with OpenAI models.
- Allows users to summarize text, get code suggestions, generate images for a website, and more.
- OpenAI models have several capabilities:
    - Generate natural language to summarize text, suggest alternate sentences, etc.
    - Generate code by translating from one language to another, identify bugs, etc.
    - Generate images for publication from text descriptions.

- What is Generative AI?
    - Generative AI models (e.g., GPT), are at the heart of OpenAI.
    - Understand and create natural language.
    - OpenAI's generative AI takes a prompt, returns a natural language, visual, or code response.
    - GPT models try to infer the context of the user's question based on the prompt.

- Natural Language tasks:
    - Summarizing text.
    - Classifying text.
    - Generating names and phrases.
    - Translating languages.
    - Answering questions.
    - Suggesting context.

- Responses generated are best guesses from a machine. They can be incredibly accurate but it's important to review the output of GenAI models for accuracy.

- GenAI models can create and edit images.
    - The model that works with images is called DALL-E.
    - Creates realistic and artistic images.
    - Change the layout or style of an image.
    - Can create variations on a provided image.

- Where do OpenAI Models fit in broader AI landscape?
    - AI imitates behavior by relying on machines to learn and execute tasks.
    - ML is a subset of AI where algorithms take in data and fit models to the data to make predictions.
    - Deep Learning models are a subset of ML where artificial neural networks are used to return results for more complex use cases.
    - Many Azure AI services are built on deep learning models.

## Azure OpenAI Service

    - Azure OpenAI Service

- Azure's existing Language Service can be used widely known use-cases that require minimal tuning.
- Azure OpenAI's service may be more beneficial for use-cases that require highly customized generative models, or for exploratory research.

- Which model to use?
    - Time and compute needs play a role in ML training.
    - Model needs to be trained with a substantial amount of cleaned data.
    - The "learning" portion of training requires a computer to identify an algorithm that best fits the data.
    - The complexity of the task and desired level of model performance factor into the time required to run through possible solutions for a best fit algorithm.

- Azure OpenAI Studio is a platform that you can use to build AI models and deploy them for public consumptions in software applications. Different models are optimized for different tasks.

- Azure OpenAI Models
    - GPT-4 models represent the latest generative modes for natural language and code.
    - GPT-3.5 models can generate natural language and code responses based on prompts.

- Getting access to Azure OpenAI
    - Requires an application process.
    - Use the service by creating an Azure OpenAI resource.
    - Use the services through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
